  <p>Just as Buju Banton words simply explains"When you rent a house you are forced to work with that structure you cant change the structure unless one undertakes the condition of the structure and adapt to it."
  Africans have adopted alot of things from the western culture which they use today.Some of the adopted things include education whereby most of the africans believe that they can only make it in life if when they've undergone through the western education system</p>
  <p>Secondly is jobs whereby africans have to go through the western education structure so as to as get a entry level into white color jobs.However, most of the africans have large pieces of land and an acces to water sources which can enable them to engage in activities such as irrigation farming and cattle keeping ,the western culture has also overriden their minds whereby they employ labourers to work on their farms hence reducing the chances of unemployment among Africans.</p>
  <p>Thirdly is the code of dresssing,whereby most of the Africans have adopted the western dressing code of which has got limitations such as indecency which is unaccepted by the african culture. </p>



  <p>Fourth,is the foods where by most of the africans have adopted to the western food neglecting their own natural foods which were natural and more healthier as compared to spiced western foods.</p>
   
  
   
    <p>Lastly,  arts,civilisations, medicine, if you have survived the invasions, central heating is great if you living in unsuitable climate, abundance of food you can eat simultaneously to the starving. A fridge and washing machine is great. Water out the tap. Western civilization has also brought forth a population explosion, and some places have the much needed sanitation of population concentration. What are the unique advantages of western civilization? I will have to look that up, but I'll get back to you if I think of anything.</p>
